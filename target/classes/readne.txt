# Ant Colony Manager - Allee Effect Population Model

A Java-based simulation game that models ant colony population dynamics using the Allee effect equation. Manage your colony through various strategic decisions while observing complex population behaviors including chaos and bifurcations.

## Population Model

The game uses the Allee effect population model:
```
x(n+1) = x(n) + r·x(n)·(1 - x(n)/K)·(x(n)/A - 1)
```

Where:
- **x** = current population (normalized)
- **r** = growth rate (reproduction rate)
- **K** = carrying capacity (maximum sustainable population)
- **A** = Allee threshold (minimum viable population)

## How to Run

1. Compile (already done):
   ```bash
   javac AntColonyGame.java
   ```

2. Run the game:
   ```bash
   java AntColonyGame
   ```

## Game Controls

### Main Control
- **New Day** - Advances time by one day, updates population, and triggers a random event

### Random Events
Every time you press "New Day", there's a chance a random event occurs! Event probabilities:
- **75% chance**: Beautiful day (no effect)
- **12% chance**: Common events (minor effects)
- **9% chance**: Uncommon events (moderate effects)
- **3% chance**: Rare events (significant effects)
- **1% chance**: Very rare events (major effects)

Events include:
- Weather changes (rain, drought, storms)
- Predator encounters
- Resource discoveries
- Disease outbreaks
- Competitor colonies
- Structural changes
- And many more!

Each event shows a notification explaining what happened and how it affects your colony parameters (r, K, or A).

### Strategic Decisions

1. **Lay More Eggs** (+20% r)
   - Increases reproductive rate
   - May lead to rapid growth or chaos
   
2. **Lay Less Eggs** (-25% r)
   - Decreases reproductive rate
   - Stabilizes population at lower levels
   
3. **Build Chambers** (+15% K, -20% A)
   - Increases carrying capacity
   - Lowers the Allee threshold (easier to sustain population)
   
4. **Destroy Chambers** (-30% K, +15% A)
   - Decreases carrying capacity
   - Raises the Allee threshold (harder to sustain population)

5. **Reset Game** - Restart with initial parameters

## Initial Parameters

- Population (x): 50 ants
- Growth rate (r): 0.5
- Carrying capacity (K): 100
- Allee threshold (A): 10

## The Four Graphs

### 1. Population History (Blue)
Shows the actual population over time from day 0 to present. This is your colony's historical record.

### 2. Population Projection (Green)
Projects the next 100 days into the future based on current parameters. A red dot marks "you are here" (current day/population). Useful for planning strategic decisions.

### 3. Lyapunov Exponent (Red)
Shows system stability for different r values:
- **Negative values** → Stable, predictable population
- **Near zero** → Periodic or quasi-periodic behavior
- **Positive values** → Chaotic, unpredictable population

### 4. Bifurcation Diagram (Magenta)
Shows all possible long-term population states for different r values with current K and A:
- Single line → Stable equilibrium
- Multiple branches → Periodic oscillations
- Scattered cloud → Chaos

## Strategy Tips

1. **Avoid Extinction**: Keep population above the Allee threshold (A)
2. **Watch for Chaos**: High r values can lead to unpredictable population swings
3. **Balance Growth**: Too much growth can crash the population
4. **Monitor Projections**: Use the green graph to see consequences before they happen
5. **Study Bifurcations**: The bifurcation diagram shows safe and dangerous r ranges

## Game Over Condition

If your population drops below 0.1, the colony goes extinct and you lose!

## Understanding the Allee Effect

The Allee effect describes situations where small populations have difficulty surviving and reproducing:
- Below threshold A: Population tends toward extinction
- Between A and K: Population can grow
- Above K: Population exceeds carrying capacity and declines

This creates interesting dynamics where populations can crash if they get too small, even if environmental conditions are good.

## Technical Details

- Built with Java Swing for the GUI
- Real-time graph updates
- Numerical simulation of nonlinear dynamics
- Lyapunov exponent calculation for chaos detection
- Bifurcation analysis for parameter space exploration
- Modular design with separate RandomEvent class
- All graphs display first quadrant only (positive values)
- Button effects use configurable parameters (not hardcoded)
- Weighted probability distribution for random events

## Code Structure

- `AntColonyGame.java` - Main game class with UI and population dynamics
- `RandomEvent.java` - Separate class handling random events with probability distribution (23 different weighted events)

## Enjoy Managing Your Colony!

Watch for emergent behaviors like:
- Period doubling routes to chaos
- Stable limit cycles
- Strange attractors
- Sensitivity to initial conditions
- Critical transitions
